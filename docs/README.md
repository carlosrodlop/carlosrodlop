# Carlosrodlop

This Mono-repo aims to be my entry point for daily work. I iam to do everything as code, creating reusable assets:

* `docs/book` (Public) Personal Notes on Tech
* `docs/cv` (Public) CV (Inspired in [mszep/pandoc\_resume: The Markdown Resume](https://github.com/mszep/pandoc_resume))
* `src/gist` (Public) Bucket for code
* `src/config` (Private) Configuration of my workstation
* `src/secrets` (Private) Encrypted secrets

Other company submodules might be linked at the moment because I am currently working with them.
