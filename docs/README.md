# Carlosrodlop

This Mono-repo aims to be my entry point for daily work, where I am to do everything as code:

* `docs/book` (Public) Personal Notes on Tech
* `docs/cv` (Public) CV
* `src/config` (Private) Configuration of my workstation
* `src/secrets` (Private) Encrypted secrets
* `src/gist` (Public) Bucket for code

Other company submodules might be linked at the moment because I am currently working with them.
